Thermostat Challenge - JS
=========================
In this challenge, I have:
- builded the logic needed to model a simple thermostat
- builded the skeleton of a UI, to interact with my underlying logic
- manipulated the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript and jQuery
- added a feature to display the weather in a city selected by the user

Challenge setup
----
Specification:
- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is `low-usage`, <= 25 is `medium-usage`, anything else is `high-usage`.

Learning Objectives covered
----
- Use Jasmine to Test-Drive Development of a thermostat
- Using HTML/CSS to create a user interface on the web
- Explain some benefits of using jQuery above 'raw' JavaScript
- Explain some common jQuery idioms, such as `$(document).ready();`
- Use jQuery to build interactive functionality into a webpage
- Understand some things about how jQuery uses the technique of callback
